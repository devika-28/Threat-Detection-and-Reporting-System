# Threat-Detection-and-Reporting-System
to identify the threats, or mishaps beforehand. To achieve this goal, we are currently detecting weapons, firearms, and any suspicious activities, apart from that if any problem occurs, it is going to try to detect if any casualties had happened, and is producing the alert.
